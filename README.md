# Problem
- the problem in education; One big reason the learning crisis persists is that many education systems across the developing world have little information on who is learning and who is not - World Bank - JANUARY 17, 2019
- The world is facing a learning crisis. While countries have significantly increased access to education, being in school isn’t the same thing as learning

# Proposed Solution
- Worldwide, hundreds of millions of children reach young adulthood without even the most basic skills like calculating the correct change from a transaction, reading a doctor’s instructions, or understanding a bus schedule—let alone building a fulfilling career or educating their children.
- It’s never too late for young people to have opportunities to learn. Our youth deserve to be equipped with the skills they need to thrive in an increasingly demanding and uncertain job world. Given that today’s students will be tomorrow’s citizens and leaders, a good and relevant education is essential to turn aspirations into reality.
- Technology is already playing a crucial role in providing support to teachers, students, and the learning process more broadly. And technology can allow principals, parents, and students to interact seamlessly.

# LearnBot
- LearnBot will enable parents, teachers and as well student track how well they are learning their lessons. 
- LearnBot is to make sure student are learning and mostly remember what they have learnt. It is a well know theory that our brain forgets what is not practiced. Learnbot teaches and mostly remind us when to study what we have learnt so it sticks to the permanent memory. 

# Proposed Stack
- PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, BALSAMIQ, LINODE

# Benefit
- Learnbot benefits teachers, students, parents, and the society.
- Learnbot is will improve the educational sector when people remember more of was learnt and consequently improve the economy.
