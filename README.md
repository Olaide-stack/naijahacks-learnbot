# Problem
- the problem in education, One big reason the learning crisis persists is that many education systems across the developing world have little information on who is learning and who is not 
- The world is facing a learning crisis. While countries have significantly increased access to education, being in school isn’t the same thing as learning

# Proposed Solution
- Worldwide, hundreds of millions of children reach young adulthood without even the most basic skills like calculating the correct change from a transaction, reading a doctor’s instructions, or understanding a bus schedule—let alone building a fulfilling career or educating their children.
- It’s never too late for young people to have opportunities to learn. Our youth deserve to be equipped with the skills they need to thrive in an increasingly demanding and uncertain job world. Given that today’s students will be tomorrow’s citizens and leaders, a good and relevant education is essential to turn aspirations into reality.
- Technology is already playing a crucial role in providing support to teachers, students, and the learning process more broadly. And technology can allow principals, parents, and students to interact seamlessly.
- learnbot will enable parents teachers and as well student track there lessons. 
- learnbot is to make sure student are learning and mostly remeber what they have learnt with the proposed theory our brain is programed to forget things we dont do all the time learnbot teaches and mostly remind us when to study what we have learnt so it sticks to the permanent memory. 

# Proposed Stack
- PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, BALSAMIQ, LINODE


# Benefit
- learnbot benefit teachers students parents and the society.
- learnbot is going to promote the educational sector with the  increase of people learning and remebering what was learnt and mosly improving the economy.
